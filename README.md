## How does the game work?
The game screen is a interface where food ingredients and knives will be displayed. Our player, Chef CocÃ´, can move in all directions and as he is in a hurry, he needs to grab all the ingredients he needs in les than 1 minute. The game is won when our Chef takes the 10 ingredients he needs in 1 minute or less!! If he accidentally bumps into a knive.. game over!

A new ingredient will appear everytime another ingredient is taken - so, you should be fast! Also, as time runs more knives will be in the board game...
